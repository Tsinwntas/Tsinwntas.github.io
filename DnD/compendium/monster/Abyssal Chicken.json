  "description": "Abyssal chickens are carnivorous, temperamental, tasty bottom-feeders native to the Abyss. They beat their leathery wings to scare predators and to help them run faster, and they taste like fatty chicken.\nWith your permission, a character who casts the find familiar spell can henceforth choose to conjure an abyssal chicken instead of a raven.\nSource: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 97"
