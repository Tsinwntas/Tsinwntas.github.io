  "description": "The enigmatic being known as Ygorl was one of the first slaadi created after Primus unleashed the Spawning Stone upon Limbo. A powerful being suffused with entropic power, Ygorl delights in the act of unmaking and bringing chaos to any ecosystem it visits. Lesser slaadi follow close behind the lord of entropy, delighting and furthering the destruction it brings.\nCycles of Chaos. As a personification of entropy, Ygorl is cursed to see things as they will become—broken and consumed by the march of eternity. It has no sense of empathy or compassion, driven only to unmake so that the resulting base elements of reality can fuel the multiverse's endless cycles of creation and destruction.\nSpeaking to Ygorl is a taxing endeavor, as the lord of entropy channels its thoughts as a stream of consciousness that is both disturbing and difficult to follow. Mortal creatures that have attempted to parley with Ygorl are known to have been driven to madness in the process.\nDeath and Destruction. Ygorl's most notable possession is an adamantine scythe with the slaad word for death inscribed across the blade, which can reduce living creatures to ash. The lord of entropy also bears a set of obsidian tablets slung about its waist, upon which it inscribes destructive runes. Living creatures wither and rot within the entropic energy emanated by Ygorl's magic.\nSource: Mordenkainen’s Fiendish Folio p. 20"
