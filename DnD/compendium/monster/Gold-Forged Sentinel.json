  "description": "The original purpose of gold-forged sentinels is a mystery, and of all Purphoros's original anvilwroughts, this construct is the most difficult to control. A sentinel often operates without a master, stalking the high places of the mortal world or waiting, still as a statue, for what could be decades before reanimating to carry out their mysterious purpose.\nThe first anvilwroughts were created by the god of the forge, Purphoros. He gave the secret of breathing life into these metal creatures to his most devoted followers so they could mimic his works and invent new forms at their own forges.\nSome anvilwroughts are vigilant guardians at holy shrines, others serve as familiars and messengers, and a few were created to emulate beauty found among the animals of the mortal world. Each exhibits abilities suited to its role, with some behaving like companionable creatures or stoic guardians.\nA few extremely rare and valuable anvilwroughts were crafted by the hand of Purphoros himself. A number of these magnificent creations are now heirlooms of monarchs; others are lost to the sands of time or are guarded by ancient monsters.\nSource: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 211"
