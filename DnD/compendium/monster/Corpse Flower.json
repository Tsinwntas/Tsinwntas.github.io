  "description": "\nCorpse-flower seedlings are quite useful for various purposes. Simply kill and bury a necromancer, and you should have a good crop in about a week.\n — Mordenkainen\n\nCorpse Flower. A corpse flower can sprout atop the grave of an evil necromancer or the remains of powerful undead. Unless it is uprooted and burned while it is still a seedling, the corpse flower grows to enormous size over several weeks, then tears itself free of the earth and begins scavenging humanoid corpses from battlefields and graveyards. Using its fibrous tentacles, it stuffs the remains into its body and feeds on carrion to repair itself. The plant has a malevolent bent and despises the living.\nHorrible Odor. With or without humanoid corpses nested in its body, a corpse flower exudes a stench of decay that can overwhelm the senses of nearby creatures, causing them to become nauseated. The stench, which serves as a defense mechanism, fades 2d4 days after the corpse flower dies.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 127",
