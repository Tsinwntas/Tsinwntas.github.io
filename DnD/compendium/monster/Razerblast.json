The razerblast's elemental overlords have replaced its heart with a flaming orb that detonates if the razerblast dies.\nRazerblasts remember little of their life before they the power of elemental fire transformed them. Now they follow the orders of the flamewraths and the cult leaders without question. Razerblasts fight confidently because they know that even if they lose, they go out in a blaze of glory.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 201"
