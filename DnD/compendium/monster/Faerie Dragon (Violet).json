  "description": "A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment fading only if it is attacked.\nInvisible Tricksters. The only warning of a faerie dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its \"prey.\"\nFriendly and Bright. A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon's draconic nature by offering it \"treasure\" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.\nThe Colors of Age. A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.\nDragon Color | Age Range\nRed | 5 years or less\nOrange | 6–10 years\nYellow | 11–20 years\nGreen | 21–30 years\nBlue | 31–40 years\nIndigo | 41–50 years\nViolet | 51 years or more\n\nCR 1 (200 XP) For a red, orange, or yellow faerie dragon; 2 (450 XP) for a green, blue, indigo, or violet faerie dragon\nSource: Monster Manual p. 133, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Explorer's Guide to Wildemount",
