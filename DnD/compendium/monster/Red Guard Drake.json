  "description": "A guard drake is a reptilian creature created out of dragon scales by means of a bizarre and grisly ritual. When trained properly, a drake is obedient, loyal, and territorial, which makes it an excellent watch-beast that can follow simple commands.\nGifts from Dragons.  The ritual to create a guard drake was originally devised by the cult of Tiamat, but has spread to other groups that are skilled in arcana and associated with dragons. The cooperation of a dragon is necessary for the ritual to succeed, and a dragon typically provides its help when it wants to reward its allies or worshipers with a valuable servant.\nThe ritual, which takes several days, requires 10 pounds of fresh dragon scales (donated by the dragon allied with the group), a large amount of fresh meat, and an iron cauldron. When the process is complete, a halfling-sized egg emerges from the cauldron and is ready to hatch within a few hours.\nA guard drake resembles the type of dragon it was created from, but with a wingless, squat, muscular build. A drake can't reproduce, nor can its scales be used to make other guard drakes.\nEager to Learn.  A newly hatched guard drake imprints upon the first creature that feeds it (usually the one planning to train it), establishing an aggressive but trusting bond with that individual. A guard drake is fully grown within two to three weeks and can be trained in the same length of time. One is the equivalent of a guard dog in terms of what it can be trained to do.\nVariant: Chromatic Guard Drakes. Each type of chromatic dragon's scales and blood creates a guard drake that resembles a wingless, stunted version of that type of dragon, with unique abilities related to that type. Each has the special features described below.\nBlack Guard Drake.  A black guard drake is amphibious (it can breathe air or water), has a swimming speed of 30 feet, and has resistance to acid damage.\nBlue Guard Drake.  A blue guard drake has a burrowing speed of 20 feet and resistance to lightning damage.\nGreen Guard Drake.  A green guard drake is amphibious (it can breathe air or water), has a swimming speed of 30 feet, and has resistance to poison damage.\nRed Guard Drake.  A red guard drake has climbing speed of 30 feet and resistance to fire damage.\nWhite Guard Drake.  A white guard drake has a burrowing speed of 20 feet, a climbing speed of 30 feet, and resistance to cold damage.\nSource: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 158",
