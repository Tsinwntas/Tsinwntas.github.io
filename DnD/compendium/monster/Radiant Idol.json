  "description": "A radiant idol was an angel that was banished from the celestial realm of Syrania and cast down to the Material Plane. One sin led to their fall: the desire to be worshiped by mortals. Now in the mortal realm, most radiant idols gather cults of devoted followers.\nFallen Angels. The insatiable hunger to be adored can transform a fallen angel, physically and mentally. In its true form, a radiant idol appears to be a warped angel. It might have bloody stumps in place of its wings, or its wings could be weighted down with chains representing its pride. A radiant idol uses disguise self to hide its corruption, presenting an image of celestial glory.\nThe Weight of Corruption. When a radiant idol achieves a sizable following through silvered words and demonstrations of power, its facade begins to crack, and a downward spiral ensues. As the radiant idol sinks deeper into the realm of material power, it begins twisting its followers, leading them ever deeper into ominous ritualism, hedonistic folly, and fanatical doom.\nImmortal Nature. A radiant idol doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 308"
