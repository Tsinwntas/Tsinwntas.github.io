  "description": "Bepis Honeymaker is a honey merchant who was kidnapped from his Trades Ward home a month ago. The Xanathar Guild tried to ransom him back, but seemingly his relatives either couldn't pay or decided not to. (In truth, his rotten in-laws destroyed the ransom notes and told Bepis's wife and children that he ran away with another family.) Ahmaergo has put him to work as a cook but threatens to give him over to the mind flayer Nihiloor every so often.\nSource: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 112"
