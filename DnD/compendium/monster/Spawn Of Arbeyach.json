Spawn of Arbeyach can communicate with each other and all swarms of insects within 60 feet via pheromone transmission. In a hive, this range extends to cover the entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication that only Arbeyach, spawn of Arbeyach, and swarms of insects can understand.
