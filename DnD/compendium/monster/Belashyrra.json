  "description": "Dreadful Visions. The madness of Belashyrra is tied to sight: images that can't be unseen, horrific hallucinations, the fear of blindness and of being watched—or realizing that something else is using your eyes. Belashyrra can force its victims to question whether what they perceive is real, or can fill their world with such terrors that they willingly blind themselves to escape.\nBelashyrra sees mortals as raw materials to be exploited or insects to be exterminated. However, the Lord of Eyes has been known to take an interest in specific mortals. Belashyrra's warlocks serve as its envoys in the world and are often directed to seek out creatures and sites that the daelkyr wishes to see through their eyes.\nBelashyrra's Cults. The Lord of Eyes has followers across Khorvaire, and its cults are typically driven by mad visions. Devoted cultists can grow eyes in unusual locations, and might have darkvision or other supernatural abilities when they view the world through those eyes. Beholderkin often advise or lead Belashyrra's cults, and cultists typically treat these aberrations as divine beings.\nBelashyrra's Lair\nBelashyrra makes its lair in the Citadel of Lidless Eyes deep in Khyber, a site that appears to have been molded from molten stone, chitin, and flesh. Across its warped and liquid expanses, thousands of eyes of every size and shape peer into the endless darkness. Beholders, dolgrims, and stranger aberrations dwell within the halls of the citadel, which is one of the few places where such creatures are willing to live side by side.\nSome beholderkin serve Belashyrra as guards and agents, while others spend their lives in deep meditation, pursuing inner visions known only to the Lord of Eyes. It's rumored that anyone who sits on the citadel's throne can see through the eyes of any sentient creature on Eberron or in Khyber. If encountered in its lair, Belashyrra has a challenge rating of 23 (50,000 XP).\nMadness of Belashyrra\nIf a creature goes mad in Belashyrra's lair or while it can see the daelkyr, it gains a form of indefinite madness. Roll on the Madness of Belashyrra table to determine the nature of this madness, which takes the form of a character flaw that lasts until cured. Chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide has more information on madness.\nMadness of Belashyrra\nd6 | Flaw (lasts until cured)\n1 | \"I constantly see shapes moving in the shadows.\"\n2 | \"I perceive certain types of people—vocations or entire societies—as hideous monsters.\"\n3 | \"Someone is watching everything I do.\"\n4 | \"When I close my eyes, I see my past misdeeds.\"\n5 | \"I don't trust my sight. I have no idea what's real and what's a hallucination.\"\n6 | \"Something watches the world through my eyes. To thwart them, I keep my eyes closed or covered.\"\n\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 286"
