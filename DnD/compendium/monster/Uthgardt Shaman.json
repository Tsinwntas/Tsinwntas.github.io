  "description": "Uthgardt barbarians are suspicious and resentful of most kinds of magic. Seldom do they choose to become shamans. Instead, the role is thrust upon those who are born with a strong connection to the spirit world. To be a shaman is to stand apart from the tribe, with one foot in the land of the living and the other in the land of the dead. Those who walk the shadowed path between two lands do so because the spirits of the dead compel them. Other Uthgardt fear and respect a shaman's power.\nAn Uthgardt shaman must possess a sacred bundle to cast spells. A sacred bundle is made up of sticks, bones, feathers, tufts of fur, and stones that have been \"touched\" by spirits. It takes a month for a shaman to assemble a sacred bundle, and a shaman can use only one such bundle at a time. A sacred bundle benefits only the shaman who created it, and it doesn't replace the normal components of a spell.\nIn addition to the spells that all Uthgardt shamans can cast, a shaman of a particular tribe gains additional spells based on tribal affiliation (see the \"Uthgardt Sha man Tribal Spells\" sidebar).\nBy communing with their ancestors' spirits, Uthgardt shamans can also learn secret rituals. These rituals almost always require some sort of blood sacrifice, and their effects are usually transformative. For example, some Black Raven shamans know a ritual that allows them to hatch giant ravens from normal raven eggs, and some shamans of the Griffon tribe can transform them selves into griffons by performing a ritual that requires them to drink copious amounts of horse blood.\nUthgardt Shaman Tribal Spells. Depending on an Uthgardt shaman's tribe, the shaman's Innate Spellcasting feature gains additional spells the shaman can cast once per day.\nBlack Lion:animate dead, chill touch, feign death, revivify\nBlack Raven:animal messenger(raven only),feather fall, polymorph(into a raven only)\nBlue Bear:enhance ability(bear's endurance only),heroism\nElk:expeditious retreat, find steed(elk only),haste\nGray Wolf:beast sense(wolf or dire wolf only),moonbeam, speak with animals(wolf or dire wolf only)\nGreat Worm:crusader's mantle, divine favor, hypnotic pattern\nGriffon:feather fall, fly\nSky Pony:divine favor, feather fall, lightning bolt\nRed Tiger:beast sense(tiger only),enhance ability(cat's grace only),jump\nThunderbeast:enhance ability(bull's strength only),pass without trace, stoneskin\nTree Ghost:barkskin, druidcraft, plant growth, speak with plants\nSource: Storm King's Thunder p. 243"
