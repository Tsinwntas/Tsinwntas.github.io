On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. While frightened in this way the creature must move away from the dullahan, and can only use its action to Dash. If the creature is affected by the dullahan's Deathly Doom trait, it is restrained while frightened instead. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the dullahan until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dullahan in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
