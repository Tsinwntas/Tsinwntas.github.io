}pirit that lives in plants, rocks, and rivers far from civilization. Painfully shy, chwingas prefer to move about unseen.\nIf two or more chwingas live in the same area, each one will take shelter in a different plant, rock, or body of fresh water. Though no two chwingas look exactly alike, they resemble 6-inch-tall animated dolls with strange masks, spindly limbs, and wild hair. Their appearance is sometimes foreshadowed by cool breezes, the sweet smell of flowers, and dancing fireflies. Their mere presence makes a natural setting more lush and vibrant.\nHumanoid Fascination. Chwingas shun most other creatures, but they find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more humanoids, its curiosity sometimes gets the better of it, and it shadows those creatures for a short time to observe them. If it takes a liking to a particular humanoid, a chwinga might use its cantrips to aid it, or might bestow a magical gift before departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular humanoid can vary. In some cases, a chwinga might simply like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair. Other times, it might be smitten by a humanoid's ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.\nElemental Nature. Chwingas sleep but don't require air, food, or drink. They don't have names and have no ability to speak. When a chwinga dies, it turns into a handful of flower petals, a cloud of pollen, a stone statuette resembling its former self, a marble of smooth stone, or a puddle of fresh water.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 216"
