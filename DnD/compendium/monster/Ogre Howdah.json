  "description": "\nVile and violent though they be, ogres prove to be tractable minions for those unafraid to be brutal masters. I prefer giants, however.\n — Mordenkainen\n\nOgre Howdah. The most unusual of the specialized ogres, the howdah carries a palisaded wooden fort on its back. The fort is big enough to serve as a fighting platform for up to four small humanoids. Ogre howdahs are most often seen bearing goblins equipped with bows and spears into battle, but they could just as easily transport kobolds, deep gnomes, or other humanoids of similar size.\nOgres. Ogres are infamously dim-witted, but with enough time and patience, some of them can be trained to carry out specialized missions in battle. The names they are given—the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdah—reflect their particular functions. These jobs are simple, but they're tailored to take advantage of an ogre's strengths.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 221",
