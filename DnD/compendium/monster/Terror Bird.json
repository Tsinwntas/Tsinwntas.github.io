        "The Queen of Birds (see page 30) is guarded by a special variety of terror birds with crimson plumage and a golden-green crest rarely seen elsewhere. These terror birds are called red queens, and they are especially savage. They gain multiattack for two serrated beak attacks, and they gain a limited form of levitation, which allows them to \"run uphill\" on empty air or to cross chasms. This movement must be completed between two portions of solid ground within two turns (with Dash actions, a red queen bird can move up to 200 feet over empty space). Red queens have a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP)"
