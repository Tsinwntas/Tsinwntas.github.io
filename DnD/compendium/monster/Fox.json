  "description": "The white arctic foxes of Icewind Dale live in burrows and are acclimated to cold weather. They prowl the outskirts of Ten-Towns and nearby forests for food, hunting hares or stealing fish. These timid creatures avoid contact with humanoids, but they are sometimes used as mounts by Chwinga.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 288"
