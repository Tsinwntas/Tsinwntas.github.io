Beginning 1d6 days after infection, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. If the saving throw fails, the victim loses 1d3 Intelligence and 1d3 Wisdom. Lost Intelligence and Wisdom can't be recovered while the disease persists. If the saving throw succeeds, nothing happens; the disease ends after the second consecutive successful saving throws. Once the disease ends, lost Intelligence and Wisdom can be restored by greaterrestoration or comparable magic. The disease is also cured by lesser restoration if the caster makes a successful DC 15 spellcasting check."
