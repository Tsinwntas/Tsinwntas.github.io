  "description": "\nIt's not just gods that have the power to bind spirits to their idols. Beings such as archdevils can do it with the souls of their cultists. Moloch, for instance.\n — Mordenkainen\n\nEidolon. The gods have many methods for protecting sites they deem holy. One servant they rely on often to do so is the eidolon, a ghostly spirit bound by a sacred oath to safeguard a place of import to the divine. Forged from the souls of those who had proven their unwavering devotion, eidolons stalk temples and vaults, places where miracles have been witnessed and relics enshrined, to ensure that no enemy can gain a foothold against the gods' cause through defilement or violence within these sites. If an enemy with such intent sets foot inside a warded location, the eidolon plunges into a graven vessel, a statue specially prepared to house the souls of these protectors. The eidolon then animates the effigy and uses the borrowed body to drive out the intruders bent on plundering the relics it is charged with guarding.\nSacred Guardians. Creating an eidolon requires a spirit of fanatical devotion—that of an individual who, in life, served with unwavering faithfulness. Upon death, a god might reward such a follower with everlasting service in the protection of a holy site. An eidolon has no purpose beyond guarding the place it was assigned to and never leaves.\nAnimated Statues. An eidolon has few methods for protecting itself beyond its ability to awaken its sacred vessels. When a foe enters, the eidolon leaps into action by merging its body with one of several statues at the site. After doing so, the eidolon controls the construct as if it was its own body and uses its fists to drive back intruders, smashing and crushing anything it can reach.\nUndead Nature. An eidolon doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 194, Essentials Kit: Divine Contention, Essentials Kit: Dragon of Icespire Peak, Infernal Machine Rebuild",
