Any living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of Akyishigal takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the character is also poisoned for 1 hour. The swarm lasts for 5 rounds; it dissipates instantly if Akyishigal takes 30 or more damage from a nonweapon attack that he doesn't have resistance to. While poisoned by the Cloak of Swarms, a character emits a stench of decomposition. All uncontrolled vermin attack that character on sight and in preference to other targets."
