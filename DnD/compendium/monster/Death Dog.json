  "description": "A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, deserts, and the Underdark. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.\nSource: Monster Manual p. 321, Storm King's Thunder, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Mythic Odysseys of Theros",
