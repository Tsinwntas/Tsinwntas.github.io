  "description": "Marauders\nVerbeeg conduct themselves like brigands, robbing people they come across in the wild. If food is scarce, they kill those same people and eat them. They prefer to dwell in forlorn places, often sharing territory with hill giants and ogres. It's not unusual to find a gang of hill giants and ogres led by a verbeeg, since verbeeg are much smarter than their brutish cousins. Verbeeg also enjoy the company of mammalian beasts and allow bears, wolves, worgs, and other predators to lair with them. They catch and keep horses, mules, sheep, goats, and cattle for food and trade.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 311"
