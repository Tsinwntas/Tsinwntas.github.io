  "description": "White Abishai. Though they are the least of their kind, white abishais fight with a reckless fury, making them ideally suited for bolstering the ranks of Tiamat's armies. White abishais fight without fear, becoming whirlwinds of destruction on the battlefield.\nAbishai. Each abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tiamat's favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul transformed into a hideous devil to serve at her pleasure in the Nine Hells.\nEmissaries of Doom. Tiamat deploys abishais as emissaries, sending them to represent her interests in the Hells and across the multiverse. Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists or taking charge of worshipers to carry out a sensitive mission. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyal to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.\nOutsiders in Hell. Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when the dark lord chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat's orders or Asmodeus's.\nThere is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus's plans invites certain destruction.\n\nTiamat is a force of Chaos bound to a place of Law. Are abishai her servants or her jailers?\n â€” Mordenkainen\n\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 163, Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus",
