Amnizus are arrogant, bullying, and ruthless, but they're also highly intelligent tacticians and unfailingly loyalâ€”qualities that the hellish archdukes value.\nGuarding the River Styx. Some amnizus perform the critical task of watching over the River Styx from fortresses along the river's blighted banks, where it flows through Dis and Stygia. Souls arriving in the form of lemure have no personalities or memories; they're driven only by the desire to commit evil. The amnizus that patrol here drill the rules of the Nine Hells into the new arrivals' pitiful brains and marshal the lemures into legions.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 164, Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus"
