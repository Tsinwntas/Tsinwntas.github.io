  "description": "Graz'zt. The appearance of the Dark Prince is a warning that not all beautiful things are good. Standing nearly nine feet tall, Graz'zt strikes the perfect figure of untamed desire, every plane and curve of his body, every glance of his burning eyes, promising a mixture of pleasure and pain. A subtle wrongness pervades his beauty, from the cruel cast of his features to the six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. Graz'zt can also transform himself at will, appearing in any humanoid form that pleases him, or his onlookers, all equally tempting in their own ways.\nGraz'zt surrounds himself with the finest of things and the most attractive of servants, and he adorns himself in silks and leathers both striking and disturbing in their workmanship. His lair, and those of his cultists, are pleasure palaces where nothing is forbidden, save moderation or kindness.\nThe dark Prince of Pleasure considers restriction the only sin, and takes what he wants. Cults devoted to him are secret societies of indulgence, often using their debauchery to subjugate others through blackmail, addiction, and manipulation. They frequently wear alabaster masks with ecstatic expressions and ostentatious dress and body ornamentation to their secret assignations.\nAlthough he prefers charm and subtle manipulation, Graz'zt is capable of terrible violence when provoked. He wields the greatsword Angdrelve, also called Wave of Sorrow, its wavy, razor-edged blade dripping acid at his command.\nGraz'zt's Lair\nGraz'zt's principal lair is his Argent Palace, a grandiose structure in the city of Zelatar, found within his Abyssal domain of Azzatar. Graz'zt's maddening influence radiates outward in a tangible ripple, warping reality around him. Given enough time in a single location, Graz'zt can twist it with his madness. Graz'zt's lair is a den of ostentation and hedonism. It is adorned with finery and decorations so decadent that even the wealthiest of mortals would blush at the excess. Within Graz'zt's lairs, followers, thralls, and subjects alike are forced to slake Graz'zt's thirst for pageantry and pleasure.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 149, Out of the Abyss p. 241"
