  "description": "This creature is an ordinary zurkhwood mushroom (see \"Fungi of the Underdark\" in chapter 2) given sentience and mobility. An awakened zurkhwood can be created by casting the awaken spell on a normal zurkhwood mushroom. A myconid sovereign can create one by performing a lengthy ritual.\nAn awakened zurkhwood has the same statistics as an awakened tree (see appendix A of the Monster Manual), with the following modifications:\n• The awakened zurkhwood has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n• If the awakened zurkhwood was created by a myconid sovereign, it can't speak.\n• The awakened zurkhwood's False Appearance feature allows it to be mistaken for a normal zurkhwood mushroom (instead of a tree).\nSource: Out of the Abyss p. 230"
