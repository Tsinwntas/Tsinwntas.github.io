  "description": "Constructed Nature. A homunculus doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nA homunculus is a construct servant created for certain tasks. Artificers and wizards are responsible for most of the homunculi in existence.\nEach kind of homunculus has a body constructed from different kinds of materials, including clay, iron, and bits of hair and feathers. The process that creates a homunculus sees those materials mixed with the creator's blood and animated through an extended magical ritual.\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 293"
