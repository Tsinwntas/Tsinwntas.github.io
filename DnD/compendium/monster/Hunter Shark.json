  "description": "Smaller than a giant shark but larger and fiercer than a reef shark, a hunter shark haunts deep waters. It usually hunts alone, but multiple hunter sharks might feed in the same area. A fully grown hunter shark is 15 to 20 feet long.\nSource: Monster Manual p. 330, Princes of the Apocalypse, Storm King's Thunder, Tales from the Yawning Portal, Tomb of Annihilation, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Essentials Kit: Dragon of Icespire Peak, Explorer's Guide to Wildemount",
