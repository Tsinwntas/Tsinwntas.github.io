  "description": "Cyclopes like those described in the Monster Manual are found primarily among the Gruul Clans. They are forces of nature, and even though they have occasionally been recruited into the Boros Legion, they can never truly be tamed.\nCyclopes serve the Izzet league as workshop guardians, personal protectors, and heavy laborers. They wear mizzium armor plating to minimize injuries from laboratory mishaps, piston gauntlets to increase their strength for lifting and punching, and telescopic helmets to minimize the shortcomings of their monocular vision. They are sometimes called monoclons or Nivix cyclopes, after the name of the Izzet guildhall.\nSource: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 216"
