  "description": "A clay gladiator fights if attacked or when called to the gladiatorial pit. If reduced to 0 hit points outside of the gladiatorial pit, the gladiator disappears along with its possessions, reappears in its cell at full health with spear and shield in hand, and returns to the gladiatorial pit if it can. If defeated in the gladiatorial pit, the gladiator leaves its spear behind before reforming in its cell\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 100"
