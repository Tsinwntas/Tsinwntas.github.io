  "description": "Giant snapping turtles can grow to be 12 feet in diameter. Although they appear slow and ponderous, they are capable of startling bursts of speed and will aggressively attack smaller creatures that approach them. One snap of a giant turtle's jaws can cut a human in half, and these creatures aren't fussy about what they eat.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 222"
