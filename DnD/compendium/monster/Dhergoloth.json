  "description": "\nA dhergoloth's head doesn't turn along with its furiously spinning torso, and its torso can spin a different direction from its dancing legs. I'd like to vivisect one at some point to find out how this can be.\n â€” Mordenkainen\n\nDhergoloth. Dhergoloths rush into battle like whirlwinds of destruction, lashing out with five sets of claws, which extend from their squat, barrel-shaped bodies. They take contracts to put down uprisings, clear out rabble, and eliminate scouts and skirmishers, and they revel in the butchery they create, their unhinged laughter rising above their victims' screams.\nSince dhergoloths are little more than dumb brutes, employers must use caution when instructing these fiends. They can handle simple orders that don't take a lot of time to resolve. When given anything complex to do, they either forget what they're told or don't listen in the first place, and then bungle the task that was set for them.\nYugoloths. Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for ever more wealth. Although yugoloths aren't especially loyal and typically try to exploit every potential loophole in a contract, they undertake any task for which they are hired, no matter how despicable. Yugoloths come in a wide variety of forms, including those described in the Monster Manual and the six creatures presented here.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 248",
