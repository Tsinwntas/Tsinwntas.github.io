All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil."
