  "description": "Arundil's Animated Objects. A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place today.\nThese animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one commanding it leaves the area.\nConstructed Nature. An animated table doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 230"
