  "description": "Gar Shatterkeel is the water prophet of Elemental Evil and the dour leader of the Crushing Wave cult. He is embittered by a life of suffering at the hands of others. Pirates killed his family when he was young, he was forced into servitude aboard a merchant ship, and then another band of pirates left him to die at sea, where he lost his arm to a shark. Gar sees the elemental power of water as the only thing of value in his life and has gathered others who feel as he does.\nGar bears the elemental weapon Drown. His missing arm has been replaced by an artificial limb in the shape of a crab's claw. As the leader of Olhydra's cult, he wields her innate magic. Other Crushing Wave cultists sense her power in him and follow him out of fear.\nIn the Water Node. When it becomes clear that the Temple of the Crushing Wave is no longer secure, Gar retreats to the Plunging Torrents, the water node. Within this node, Gar gains one additional use of his Legendary Resistance trait.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 208"
