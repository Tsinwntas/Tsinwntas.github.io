  "description": "Elite warriors of the earth cult, burrowsharks are fierce champions who ride trained bulettes into battle. While their powerful mounts rend and tear foes to pieces, burrowsharks leap to the ground and cut down their foes without mercy.\nBurrowsharks are much like Black Earth guards, since both have uncanny footing and special armor. For burrowsharks, an additional gift of Ogremoch's might establishes a magical bond between the burrowshark and a bulette, allowing the rider to burrow with its mount and sense what its mount senses.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 196"
