  "description": "Physically identical to one another, lava children have muscular builds and childish, perpetually grinning faces. Most are born in the Fountains of Creation, also known as the Plane of Magma, which is wedged between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire. Within volcanic caverns, lava children form communities, serving primordial beings out of fear or worshiping gods of earth and fire.\nThough they're not violent by nature, lava children fiercely defend territory they claim as their own. Many intruders have been fooled by a lava child's smile, believing themselves welcome when in fact they're about to be torn limb from limb. Lava children typically stick close to their lairs, but actively hunt when food grows scarce.\nSource: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 313"
