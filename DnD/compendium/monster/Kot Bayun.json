This target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or fall asleep. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Each round the kot bayun maintains its song, it can select a new target. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the effect of that kot bayun's song for 24 hours. The slumbering song even affects elves, but they have advantage on the Charisma saving throw."
