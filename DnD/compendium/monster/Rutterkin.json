  "description": "Rutterkin. The rutterkins, a breed of warped demon, roam the Abyss in mobs that constantly search for intruders to surround and devour.\nAbyssal Defenders. Rutterkins protect the Abyss from non-demons. When they spot any interlopers, they gather in a crowd and surge forward, emitting a wave of fear in advance of their attacks that leaves their victims terrified and rooted in place.\nWarping Plague. Creatures bitten by rutterkins are exposed to a terrible disease that infects them with the corrupting influence of the Abyss. Victims that succumb to the disease experience tremendous pain as their bodies become disfigured, flesh twisting around the bones, until they transform to join the mass of abyssal wretches that follow in the wake of the rutterkin mob that laid them low.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 136"
