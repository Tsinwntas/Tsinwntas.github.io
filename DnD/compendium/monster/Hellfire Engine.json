Constructs and devils are immune to this effect."

  "description": "Hellfire Engine. Hellfire engines are semi-autonomous bringers of destruction. amnizu and other devilish generals hold them in reserve until they are needed to repel an incursion by demons or crusading mortals, but occasionally one of these mechanical and magical hybrids gets loose, driven berserk by its need to destroy.\nMany Forms, One Purpose. Hellfire engines take many forms, but all of them have one purpose: to mow down foes in waves. They are incapable of subtlety or trickery, but their destructive capability is immense.\nSoul Trapping. Mortal creatures slain by hellfire engines are doomed to join the infernal legions in mere hours unless powerful magic-wielders intervene on their behalf. The archdukes would like nothing better than to modify this magic so it works against demons, too, but that discovery has eluded them so far.\nConstructed Nature. A hellfire engine doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 165"
