  "description": "In an effort to create a weird that could be more easily controlled, Izzet mages tried binding elemental lightning, fire, and smoke into a framework made of the magical alloy mizzium. The experiment was partly successful: the resulting weird, a fluxcharger, doesn't explode like some other weirds do, but it is more intelligent and more headstrong than other weirds.\nA fluxcharger's mizzium frame is suggestive of an angel. A faceplate is meant to give it some personality, but most people find its solemn expression and unblinking stare more unnerving than relatable.\nIzzet Weirds. Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments intended to combine two opposing elemental types in the hope of creating elementals that were more stable than the norm and easier to control. As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.\nElemental Nature. An Izzet weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 208"
