  "description": "Several new zombie variants are presented below. For more information on zombies, see the Monster Manual.\nAnkylosaurus Zombie. This creature is slow and barely aware of its surroundings.\nGirallon Zombie. Girallons are four-armed apes with white fur. Girallon zombies are slower than their non-undead counterparts but no less fierce. The necromantic energy empowering them fuels their murderous hearts and their hunger for living flesh.\nTyrannosaurus Zombie. A tyrannosaurus zombie has a gullet full of smaller zombies, which it can disgorge. These zombies aren't under the tyrannosaurus zombie's control.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 240"
