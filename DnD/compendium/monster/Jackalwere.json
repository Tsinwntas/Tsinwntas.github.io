  "description": "Ordinary jackals tainted by demonic power, jackalweres haunt roads and trails, waylaying and murdering those they meet.\nA jackalwere has three physical forms that it shifts between. In its true form, it is indistinguishable from a normal jackal. It can take human form, often appearing gaunt and affecting a wretched demeanor to beg goodwill from strangers. When travelers welcome a jackalwere into their midst, the monster adopts its human-sized hybrid form, with the fur and head of a jackal but standing on two legs as it attacks.\nBeguilers and Cowards. The demon lord Graz'zt created jackalweres to serve his devoted servants, the lamias. Reaching out from the Abyss, he bestowed jackals with the gift of speech and the ability to assume humanoid forms. A jackalwere is born to lie, and perceptive creatures might notice it wincing in pain when it speaks the truth.\nA jackalwere prefers to fight alongside jackals and others of its kind. Under the direction of jackalweres, jackals are fierce and loyal companions.\nSupernatural Servants. Jackalweres kidnap humanoids for their lamia masters, condemning victims to a lifetime of slavery or an agonizing death. A jackalwere's magical gaze renders a foe unconscious, allowing the monster to bind a creature or drag it away.\nA jackalwere might also use its gaze to incapacitate a deadly enemy long enough to make good its escape.\nSource: Monster Manual p. 193, Princes of the Apocalypse, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus",
