The archdruid can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The archdruid reverts to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The archdruid can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.",

It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its new form.",

An archdruid typically has one or more pupils who are druids (see the Monster Manual for statistics), and the archdruid's lair is usually guarded by loyal beasts and fey creatures.\nSource: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 210, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Mythic Odysseys of Theros",
