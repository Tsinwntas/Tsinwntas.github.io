  "description": "Ghald is an 8-foot-tall, four-armed sahuagin who works with a partner, Unferth, for the Kraken Society in Yartar. He's careful not to emerge from his hiding place beneath the docks unless it's dark and rainy, and even then he hides under a bulky cloak. He and Unferth serve as the Kraken Society's top operatives in this part of the North, and specialize in advancing the agenda of the society through theft, intimidation, and assassination.\nWhen the thieves' guild known as the Hand of Yartar comes into possession of a powerful elemental weapon (see the \"Dark Dealings in Yartar\" side trek in chapter 6), Ghald and Unferth make sure the Kraken Society comes in with the top bid. They then make sure that no one else interferes.\nSource: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 210"
