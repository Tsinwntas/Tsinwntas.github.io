  "description": "Leviathan. A towering wall of water that drags ships down to the ocean's depths and washes away coastal settlementsâ€”that phenomenon typifies the destruction a leviathan can unleash on the world. When called forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water to form an immense serpent-shaped creature.\nElder Elementals. On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.\nDeadly When Summoned. The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.\nElemental Nature. An elder elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 198",
