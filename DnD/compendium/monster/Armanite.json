  "description": "Armanite. Great herds of armanites race across the blasted fields of the Abyss, bent on slaughter and death, driven by unrestrained bloodlust. Whether being controlled by more powerful demons or charging into battle for the sake of it, armanites use their claws, hooves, and long, whip-like tails to tear apart their foes.\nLive for War. In the armies of the demon lords, armanites perform the role of heavy cavalry, leading the charge and tearing into their enemies' flanks. Armanites fight all the time, even among themselves if they can't find another enemy. They make ideal shock troops, courageous to the point of stupidity and utterly savage.\nWalking Arsenal. Part of what makes armanites so fearsome is the number of weapons they have at their disposal. They possess sharp hooves, claws that end in curling talons, and long, serrated tails that can flense the flesh from a victim, and they use them all to carve through their foes. When they are up against tough formations, they can call on their innate magic to loose bolts of lightning and blow holes in the enemy ranks.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 131",
