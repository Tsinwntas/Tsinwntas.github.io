  "description": "Many of those who brave the Tomb of Horrors believe they have reached their ultimate destination when they disturb a skeletal figure inside a secluded crypt. It is, in fact, a greater zombie, a creature magically created from a humanoid corpse to be far more resilient than a typical zombie.\nUndead Nature. A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 237, Essentials Kit: Divine Contention, Essentials Kit: Sleeping Dragon's Wake, Infernal Machine Rebuild"
