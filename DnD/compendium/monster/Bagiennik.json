A similar application on an already-stable creature or one with 1 or more hit points acts as a potion of healing, restoring 2d4 + 2 hit points. Alternatively, the bagiennik's secretion can have the effect of a lesser restoration spell. However, any creature receiving a bagiennik's Healing Oil must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be slowed for 1 minute."
