  "description": "Decapuses are carnivorous, solitary hunters that swing through trees, scooping up prey with their 10-foot-long, suckered tentacles. Decapuses also use their tentacles to climb walls and ceilings.\nAfter securing a high vantage point, a decapus hangs by one tentacle and attacks with the other nine. On the ground, a decapus is slower and less dangerous. It must use half of its tentacles to support its weight upright, leaving five tentacles with which it can attack and defend itself.\nMarine Decapus. A marine decapus is similar to its land-dwelling cousin, except that it gains a swimming speed of 30 feet and can breathe only underwater.\nSource: The Tortle Package p. 21"
