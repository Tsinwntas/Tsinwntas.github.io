  "description": "Buster the Bear is a lovable, roly-poly teddy bear with a plaid shirt, torn jeans, and a banjo.\nThe five automatons that serve as the tavern's wait staff each have a name tag, are super friendly to the patrons, and attend to everyone's needs until it comes time for the Slaughterfest. If an automaton is attacked before the Slaughterfest, it giggles and repeats folksy homilies until it is destroyed. The next round, it magically pops back to life fully healed, then asks, \"What can I do for ya?\"\nSource: The Lost Dungeon of Rickedness: Big Rick Energy p. 27"
