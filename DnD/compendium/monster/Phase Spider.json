Its movement on the Ethereal Plane before coming back to the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.\nSource: Monster Manual p. 334, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Essentials Kit: Dragon of Icespire Peak, Essentials Kit: Sleeping Dragon's Wake, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden",
