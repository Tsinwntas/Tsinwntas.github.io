  "description": "Roleplaying Auril\nPortraying a deity, even a lesser god such as Auril the Frostmaiden, can be daunting. For roleplaying purposes, the following suggestions might prove helpful:\n• So long as she has mortal worshipers, Auril can't truly die (although the characters can rid the world of her for a time). Thus, she has no reason to capitulate to mortals' demands. As the embodiment of winter's cruelty, she is incapable of showing mercy or compassion. Play her as a supremely cold and unfeeling entity.\n• Have Auril speak only when necessary. The less she talks, the less risk you have of unintentionally demystifying her in the eyes of your players. Let her actions, not her words, define her.\n• Lesser gods in the D&D multiverse are extremely powerful and arrogant, but also fallible and blind to their own flaws. It's appropriate for Auril to act as though she's invincible while underestimating her mortal enemies, even in her current weakened state.\nLair Actions\nAuril dwells on Solstice, a frozen island hidden among the titanic icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Few creatures know of this island, let alone how to reach it. See chapter 5 for information about the regional effects that encompass the island.\nWhile she's on the island, the Frostmaiden can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):\n• Auril instantly knows the locations and health of all other creatures on the island. She knows how much damage each of these creatures has taken, how many levels of exhaustion they have, and what conditions are affecting them currently.\n• Auril instantly teleports to any location on the island. If the space she chooses as her destination is already occupied, Auril appears in the closest unoccupied space to it instead.\n• Auril telepathically communicates with any number of creatures at once, provided they're all on the island. This effect lasts until Auril stops concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) or until she leaves the island or uses a different lair action.\nAuril's Three Forms\nIn her current weakened state, Auril can assume three different forms. To destroy her, heroes must reduce each of her forms to 0 hit points one after another. After she's defeated in her third and final form, Auril dies. As long as she has mortal followers who worship her, however, Auril is reborn at full strength during the next winter solstice, with divine power far beyond what is reflected in the stat blocks presented here.\nAfter finishing a long rest, Auril regains any of her forms that were destroyed, provided at least one form survives. When she transitions from one form to another, she loses all the traits and actions of the old form and gains those of the new form.\nA stat block is given for each of Auril's three forms. These descriptions do not reflect Auril at full power, but rather Auril as she is encountered in this adventure.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 278"
