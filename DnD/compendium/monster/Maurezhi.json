  "description": "Maurezhi. When Doresain, the King of Ghouls, corrupted a society of elves, he created a new breed of demons to lead packs of ghoul and ghast in the material world.\nHorrid Infiltrators. When a maurezhi consumes the corpse of a humanoid it has slain—a process that takes about 10 minutes—it instantly assumes the creature's appearance as it was in life. The new appearance begins to rot away over the next few days, eventually revealing the demon's original form.\nA Plague of Ghouls. . Maurezhi are contagion incarnate. Their bite attacks can drain a victim's sense of self. If this affliction is allowed to go far enough, the victim is infected with an unholy hunger for flesh that overpowers their personality and transforms them into a ghoul.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 133",
