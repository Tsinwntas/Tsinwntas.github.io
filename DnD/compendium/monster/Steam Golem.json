In the case of a water elemental, dousing a steam golem destroys the elemental and the golem must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the water instantly evaporates and the golem continues functioning normally. If it fails, the golem's fire is extinguished and the boiler loses pressure. The steam golem acts as if affected by a slow spell for 1d3 rounds, then becomes paralyzed until its fire is relit and it spends 15 minutes building up pressure."
