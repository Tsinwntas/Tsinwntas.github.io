Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion.

  "description": "\nNo creature embodies the chaotic nature of the Abyss so well as the sibriex. Although the realm of the demons is already a place of infinite horrors, sibriexes for some reason make even more of these monstrosities.\n â€” Mordenkainen\n\nSibriex. Thought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt remote parts of the plane, where they use their vile abilities to breed new horrors and apprehend forbidden lore. Rivulets of blood and bile cascade from a sibriex's body. Where these noxious fluids hit the ground, the land scape becomes polluted.\nKeepers of Forbidden Lore. Sibriexes have spent eons amassing information from across the planes, hoarding knowledge for when it might be useful. Such is their incredible intellect that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, while other sibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out lore only when doing so would advance their plans.\nDemon Crafters. Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers of rutterkins to protect their lands and to ensure that the plane teems with destructive monsters. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they are moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demons greater strength, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely; they demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 137, Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus",
