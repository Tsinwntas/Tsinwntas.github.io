The item must be in the gear mage's hands and under its control; the mage can't, for example, reshape a piece of armor or a weapon that's being worn or wielded by someone else. To create a specific object, such as a key or mechanical component, the gear mage must be completely familiar with it. Thus, it could replicate a key that it had in its possession for an extended period of time, but it could not create a working key based on seeing the lock alone. Objects the gear mage creates can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail is not possible."
