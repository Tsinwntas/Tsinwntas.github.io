  "description": "The Red Wizards (Dead in Thay) make use of several kinds of undead minions, including the special servants known as dread warriors. After being created by a secret ritual, a dread warrior is further enchanted so that a Red Wizard can employ the creature in the fashion of a spellcaster's familiar. By creating a psychic link with a dread warrior, a Red Wizard can experience the world through the creature's senses and direct the warrior.\nUndead Nature. A dread warrior doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 233"
