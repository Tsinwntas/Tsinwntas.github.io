While poisoned this way, the target takes 10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, from liquefaction of its innards. A successful save renders the target immune to the koralk's poison for 24 hours. If a creature dies while poisoned by a koralk, its body bursts open, spewing vile liquid and a newly-formed lemure devil. The lemure is under the command of any higher-order devil nearby. The poison can be neutralized by lesser restoration, protection from poison, or comparable magic. If the lemure is killed, the original creature can be restored to life by resurrection or comparable magic."
