While the two are bonded, the master can sense what Majesto senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While Majesto is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares Majesto's Magic Resistance trait. If its master violates the terms of the contract, Majesto can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond."
