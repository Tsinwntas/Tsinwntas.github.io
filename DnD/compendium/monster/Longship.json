  "description": "Example Longship Crew\nA longship requires a crew of forty to properly sail or row the vessel and often carries extra passengers or soldiers. If the characters are guests on a longship, the crew consists of the following creatures, all of which have proficiency with water vehicles in addition to their normal statistics:\n• One captain (berserker)\n• Five other officers: a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, a surgeon, and a cook (berserker)\n• Thirty-four sailors (commoner)\nLongship Deck\nThe deck of the longship has the following features:\n• Oars. Sixteen benches are built into the deck, each with a 15-foot-long oar. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars. Five spare oars hang on the walls.\n• Railing. The deck has a 3-foot-high rail covered in wooden shields around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.\nSource: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 190"
