  "description": "Hydroloth. Like the thought-stealing waters of the River Styx they inhabit, hydroloths filch the memories of creatures they attack, stealing away their thoughts for delivery to whatever master they happen to serve. Hydroloths are skilled at finding lost things, especially those that have been swallowed up in the deeps.\nFor amphibious assaults or underwater conflicts, hydroloths have no equal among yugoloths. They sometimes hire themselves out to attack and scuttle ships and raid coastal settlements.\nYugoloths. Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for ever more wealth. Although yugoloths aren't especially loyal and typically try to exploit every potential loophole in a contract, they undertake any task for which they are hired, no matter how despicable. Yugoloths come in a wide variety of forms, including those described in the Monster Manual and the six creatures presented here.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 249"
