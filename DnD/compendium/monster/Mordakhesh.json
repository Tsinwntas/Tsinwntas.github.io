  "description": "In the age when fiends and dragons waged war across Eberron, rakshasas served the fiendish lords as strategists and generals. A rakshasa named Mordakhesh rose up through the ranks to become one of the greatest commanders of his age, and a dragon-slaying specialist. For this, he earned the nickname Shadowsword, along with a legendary reputation for leaving death in his wake.\nMordakhesh serves as the prakhutu or \"speaker\" of his imprisoned master, Rak Tulkhesh, and he seeks to free his lord by bathing the world in blood. Like a spider with multiple webs, he has agents and pawns (which he calls his \"claws\") established in armies across Khorvaire. The most significant of those is the barbarian horde he amasses in the Demon Wastes—warriors who threaten to sweep into Aundair on a tide of blood.\nMany of the horrors of the Last War were instigated—or at least encouraged—by Mordakhesh's operatives, and his claws are known to have perpetrated some of the most brutal massacres of that conflict. No one knows how far the Shadowsword's reach extends, or which commanders in the armies of Khorvaire serve him.\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 301"
