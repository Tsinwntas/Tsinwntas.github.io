Mi-go technology can be represented using the same rules as magic items, but the functions are very difficult to determine. The identify spell can't determine the function of a mi-go item, but an hour of study and a successful DC 19 Intelligence (Arcana) check can reveal its purpose and proper function. Typical items are wands of fireballs shaped like staves with peculiar triggers, eyes of the eagle shaped as a pair of cylinders, or a helm of telepathy in the form of a glowing metal disc adhered to the side of the creature's head."
