  "description": "Bhaal's cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\nBloodletters. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god's power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal's magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim's body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\nKillers from the Shadows. Bhaal's followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god's power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\nCult Ranks. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called night blades, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. Reapers are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal's magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the death's heads, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal's schemes is futile.\nSource: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 233"
