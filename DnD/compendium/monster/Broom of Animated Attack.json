  "description": "A broom of animated attack is easily mistaken for a broom of flying. It attacks any creature that grabs it or tries to ride it.\nFlying Broom. Some brooms of animated attack allow their creators to ride them, in which case they behave like typical brooms of flying. A broom of animated attack, however, can carry only half the weight that a broom of flying can (see chapter 7, \"Treasure,\" of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\nSource: Curse of Strahd p. 226"
