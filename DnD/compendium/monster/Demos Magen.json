  "description": "Demos magen wear armor, wield weapons, and typically serve as guards.\nMagen are magical, humanlike beings created by a wizard spell (see the create magen spell in appendix D) or by other arcane methods.\nThough magen look like humanoids with green skin, they are constructs. When one is wounded, its blood is seen to have the color and consistency of mercury. They exist purely through magical means. When one is killed, its body disappears in a burst of harmless fire and a cloud of smoke that quickly dissipates.\nSource: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 300"
