  "description": "Dal Quor is the plane of dreams and is currently dominated by a dark power known as il-Lashtavar, or the Dreaming Dark. Il-Lashtavar is served by a host of aberrations that are the embodiments of dreams and nightmaresâ€”the quori. Because it is difficult for anything to physically travel to or from Dal Quor, quori in Eberron are typically encountered while possessing a host body. The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 307"
