A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove the bone by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The bone also falls out of the wound if the target receives magical healing A yek typically carries 3 (1d6) bone shards, which are destroyed on a successful hit. It can use its action to tear a bone shard from a corpse within 5 feet."
