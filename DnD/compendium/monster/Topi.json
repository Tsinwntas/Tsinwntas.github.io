  "description": "Topis are similar to zombies. Before a topi is animated, its corpse is shrunk until it stands only 2 feet tall, and its heart is cut out and replaced with a leather bag that contains a live poisonous snake. The snake requires neither air nor sustenance, and it magically renders the topi's claws venomous. When a topi dies, the snake inside it dies too. The process of creating a topi is known only to a handful of evil priests and necromancers.\nTopis are more difficult to turn than ordinary zombies, and their spongy bodies make them resistant to bludgeoning.\nUndead Traits. A topi doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\nSource: The Tortle Package p. 22"
