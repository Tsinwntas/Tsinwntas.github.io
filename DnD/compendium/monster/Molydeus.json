  "description": "Molydeus. The most ruthless and dangerous of demons—more feared than the dreaded balor—the molydeus speaks with the authority of the demon lord it serves as it enforces its master's will. Standing some 12 feet tall, a molydeus has a red-skinned, humanoid body and two heads—one that of a slavering wolf and the other that of a serpent with dripping fangs perched atop a long neck.\nMolydei might guard their masters' possessions, roam the battlefields of the Abyss to ensure the loyalty of troops, or bring swift death to their enemies.\nBranded and Bound. When a demon earns the attention of a demon lord through ferocity, cunning, or an act of surprising devotion, the demon lord might reward such service by snatching up the fiend and subjecting it to excruciating torments to remake it into a molydeus.\nVoice of the Master. A demon lord has a direct link to its molydeus and uses the serpent head to communicate its wishes. A molydeus is, therefore, said to utter its master's will, commanding other demons to carry out orders and using violence to ensure they obey. A molydeus must constantly be ready for the scrutiny of its master, for the demon lord can decide at any moment to observe the molydeus through the serpent. Thus, there is no room for treachery in a molydeus.\nSpecial Weapon. As part of a demon lord's trust in its molydeus, it bestows a powerful weapon upon the guardian demon. The demon lord fashions the weapon from a portion of the fiend's essence, so that the demon and its weapon are forever bound. If the molydeus dies, the weapon dissolves into a pool of foul-smelling slime. It's possible to steal such a weapon, but a molydeus deprived of its weapon will stop at nothing to regain it.\nThe weapon a molydeus wields reflects the nature of its master. Those that serve Baphomet carry a glaive; Demogorgon, a whip; Fraz-Urb'luu, a battleaxe; Graz'zt, a greatsword; Orcus, a morningstar; and Yeenoghu, a flail. The weapon's form doesn't affect its capabilities.\nDark Guardians. One of the chief tasks of any molydeus is to help protect its master's amulet—the most prized possession of any demon lord. Each of these dangerous relics allows a demon lord to return to life in the Abyss if the unthinkable occurs and its abyssal form is destroyed. As useful as these amulets are, they are also liabilities—because, armed with an amulet, a creature can coerce the demon lord to which it belongs into doing its bidding, or can strand it in the Abyss if the amulet is destroyed.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 134"
