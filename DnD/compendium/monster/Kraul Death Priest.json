  "description": "The death priests occupy the highest roles in kraul society. They lead the buzzing chants of the kraul rites. Their inscrutable clicks and buzzing can summon crippling necromantic magic, and the presence of death seems to fortify them. They draw power from the defeat of their enemies and channel it to their followers, ensuring the continuation of the cycle.\nThe current leader of the kraul is a death priest named Mazirek.\nKraul. The kraul are an ascendant power group within the Golgari Swarm, long content to linger at the margins of the undercity but now increasingly making their buzzing voices heard in the subterranean Golgari guildhall. These six-legged, insectile beings are hard-headed and literal-minded, with little grasp of metaphor or nuance.\nSource: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 214"
