A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the stun on itself on a success. The hit point reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest and drinks abundant water or until it is affected by greater restoration or comparable magic. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0."
