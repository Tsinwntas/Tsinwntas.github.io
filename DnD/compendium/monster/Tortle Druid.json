  "description": "Tortles. Tortles are omnivorous, turtle-like humanoids with shells that cover most of their bodies. Tortles have a saying: \"We wear our homes on our backs.\" Consequently, tortles feel little need to stay put for long.\nAn adult tortle stands about 6 feet tall and weighs between 450 and 500 pounds. Males and females are nearly identical in size and appearance.\nTemporary Towns. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another and trade with strangers. Tortles don't regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.\nA Life of Wandering. Most tortles like to see how other creatures live and discover new customs. The urge to procreate doesn't kick in until the end of a tortle's life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 242, The Tortle Package p. 23",
