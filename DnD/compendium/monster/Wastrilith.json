  "description": "\nThe corruption left behind when a wastrilith visits the world can persist for decades. If left unchecked, it can become a bridge to the Abyss.\n — Mordenkainen\n\nWastrilith. Found in the waters of the Abyss and other bodies of water contaminated by the plane's fell influence, wastriliths establish themselves as lords of the deep and rule their dominions with cruelty.\nDespoilers. A wastrilith contaminates the waters around it. Its noxious presence even affects nearby sources of water when the demon travels on land. The corrupted water, which contains a measure of the demon's essence, responds to its commands—perhaps hardening to prevent foes from escaping, or erupting in a surge that drags would-be victims into its reach.\nSilent Corrupters. Creatures that ingest water that has been corrupted by a wastrilith risk their very souls. Those who drink the poisonous liquid might wither away until they finally die, or remain alive only to become a thrall of chaos and evil.\nTo represent this defilement, you can use the optional rule on planar effects in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, causing the poisoned creature to be corrupted.\nSource: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 139",
