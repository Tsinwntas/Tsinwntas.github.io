  "description": "Yuan-ti malisons who become priestly devotees of a particular god-be it Sseth, Dendar the Night Serpent, or Merrshaulk-often rise through the ranks to become spiritual leaders among the serpent folk. These priests perform sacrificial rites to appease their vile gods.\nYuan-ti Mind Whisperer. Mind whisperers are malison spellcasters that enter into a pact with the serpent god Sseth, the Sibilant Death. They use their abilities to convert others to their faith, increase their personal power, and befuddle the minds of their enemies.\nA mind whisperer is elusive, manipulative, unpredictable, and willing to cheat or kill comrades and rivals alike if doing so benefits it. The worshipers of Sseth have their hands in many schemes, often plying the middle ground between two factions, and thus spend a lot of energy making sure neither of their allies learn of their conflicting connections. Even among yuan-ti, mind whisperers are known for being self-important, sneaky, and prone to flee at the first sign of trouble.\nThis malison is the type that has a human body and a snake head.\nSource: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 204",
