  "text": "You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and another 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.\nSource: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 170, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 23",
