Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:\n• You are immune to fire damage and have resistance to cold damage.\n• Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 fire damage.\n• You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nSource: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 159, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 19",
