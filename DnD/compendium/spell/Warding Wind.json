The wind lasts for the spell's duration.\nThe wind has the following effects:\n• It deafened you and other creatures in its area.\n• It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.\n• It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.\n• The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.\n• The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.\nSource: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 170, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 23"
