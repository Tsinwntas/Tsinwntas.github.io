  "text": "You seize the air and compel it to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:\n• One Medium or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you.\n• You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage.\n• You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters closed, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.\nSource: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 157, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 19, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 107, Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 50"
