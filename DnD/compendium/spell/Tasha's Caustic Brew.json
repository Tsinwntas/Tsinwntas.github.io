Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes 2d4 acid damage at start of each of its turns.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 115",
