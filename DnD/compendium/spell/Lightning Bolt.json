A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.\nSource: Player's Handbook p. 255",
