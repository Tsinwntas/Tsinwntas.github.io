    "When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to fire through multiple opponents.  The initial attack gains a +1 to the firearmâ€™s misfire score.  On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and you make an attack roll with disadvantage against every creature in a line directly behind the target within your first range increment.  Only the initial attack can misfire.",
