On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\nSource: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 155, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 17",
