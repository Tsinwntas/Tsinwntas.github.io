    "You call a roggenwolf within range to your side (though it may take some time to get to you) and can verbally communicate with it for the duration. If you make an offering of meat and a successful DC 13 Charisma ability check, the roggenwolf will give you information about nearby locations and prey, including whatever it has seen within the past day. You might be able to persuade a roggenwolf to attack a particular creature or howl at a particular location, at the GM's discretion.\nSource: CCodex (3pp) p. 320"
