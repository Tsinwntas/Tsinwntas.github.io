  "text": "You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number it rolled determines the type of damage, as shown below.\nChaos Bolt\nd8 | Damage Type\n1 | Acid\n2 | Cold\n3 | Fire\n4 | Force\n5 | Lightning\n6 | Poison\n7 | Psychic\n8 | Thunder\nIf you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by this mass of chaotic energy.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes extra damage of the type rolled. The extra damage equals 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Starter Spells p. 2",
