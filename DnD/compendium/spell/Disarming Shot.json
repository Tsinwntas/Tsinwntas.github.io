    "When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to shoot an object from their hands.  On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop 1 held object of your choice and have that object pushed 10 feet away from you.",
