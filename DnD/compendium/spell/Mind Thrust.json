On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can use its action only to Dash or Disengage on its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and this spell doesn't limit its action options.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter Rogue Wizard p. 7",
