  "text": "You call forth the spirit of a beast. The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Bestial Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature physically resembles an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which also determines one of the movement modes in the creature's stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell's duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.\nAt Higher Levels:\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell's level in its stat block.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Spells And Magic Tattoos p. 3"
