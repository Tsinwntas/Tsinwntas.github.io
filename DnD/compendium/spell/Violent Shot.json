    "When you make a fireman attack against a creature, you can expend one or more grit points to enhance the volatility of the attack.  For each grit point expended, the attack gains a +2 to the firearmâ€™s misfire score.  If the attack hits, you can roll one additional weapon damage per grit point spent when determining the damage.",
