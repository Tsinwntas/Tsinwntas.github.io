      "text": "Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.\nYou aren't one of those folk.\nYou are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerûn for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.\nAlthough you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go.\n\n• Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception\n• Tool Proficiencies: Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland\n• Languages: Any one of your choice\n• Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp\nSource: Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 148"

Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.\nYou can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.\n"

      "text": "d6 | Personality Trait\n1 | I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others' space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.\n2 | I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.\n3 | I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don't comprehend.\n4 | I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.\n5 | I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land.\n6 | I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Open.
