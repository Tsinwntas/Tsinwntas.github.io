      "text": "A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.\nd8 | Personality Trait\n1 | I judge people by their actions, not their words.\n2 | If someone is in trouble, I'm always ready to lend help.\n3 | When I set my mind to something, I follow through no matter what gets in my way.\n4 | I have a strong sense of fair play and always try to find the most equitable solution to arguments.\n5 | I'm confident in my own abilities and do what I can to instill confidence in others.\n6 | Thinking is for other people.
