As a result, you can arrange a meeting with a low-ranking operative of nearly any business, patriar family, crew, government institution, or—certainly—the Guild. This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion, take your information or request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.\n"

      "text": "Criminals are pervasive in Baldur's Gate. If you wish, you may roll on the Criminal Origins table for an event that began your life of crime.\nCriminal Origins\nd8 | Origin\n1 | You crippled a Guild kingpin's cousin without realizing the connection. You got the Guild to back off demands for your death by offering to make amends by working for the criminals, but even so the kingpin still plots a personal revenge.\n2 | The Guild took over your family business, ran it into the ground, and burned the building for insurance money. You were driven into crime yourself, but you'll never work for the Guild. You take special joy in hitting its targets first, tipping off its con victims and otherwise frustrating its schemes.\n3 | It's always been about money. You're not paid what you're worth, working for someone who has more than they deserve. But the Guild offered you a way to fix that. You keep doing what you've always done—guard work, dock labor, business accounting—but what you learn you pass on to the Guild.\n4 | The inequality of Baldur's Gate has driven you to take matters into your own hands. You steal from patriars and rich Lower City residents, funneling the money through charitable fronts to help the needy.\n5 | You got into crime as a bored patriar looking for excitement. Your family has no idea of your activities, and neither does the Guild. If either of them ever finds out, your life as you know it will be over.\n6 | A close friend or relative joined the Guild and vanished mysteriously. You've worked your way into the lower ranks hoping to find out what happened to them.\n7 | You've always wanted to be a member of the Guild. As a child, you looked up to the Guild members' swagger, their flashy dress, and their competence, which all marked them as different from the other adults you knew. As soon as you could, you joined the organization.\n8 | To you, this is just a way to earn a living. You go to work, do what needs to be done, and get paid. Anyone who pursues crime for thrill-seeking, to strike back at unjust authorities, or anything else are amateurs, and they're liable to get you arrested or killed with their idiocy.\n\n"

      "name": "Suggested Characteristics",
      "text": "Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.\nd8 | Personality Trait\n1 | I always have a plan for when things go wrong.\n2 | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.\n3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden.\n4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.\n5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.\n6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.\n7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.\n8 | I blow up at the slightest insult.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)\n2 | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)\n3 | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)\n4 | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil)\n5 | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral)\n6 | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)\n\nd6 | Bond\n1 | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.\n2 | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.\n3 | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.\n4 | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.\n5 | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.\n6 | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.\n2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.\n3 | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.\n4 | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.\n5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad.\n6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.\n\n"
