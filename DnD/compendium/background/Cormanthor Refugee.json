      "name": "Suggested Characteristics",
      "text": "d8 | Personality Trait\n1 | I long for a home that never really existed, whether in the camps, Hillsfar, or Myth Drannor.\n2 | Though I am not an elf, I am a fervent, radical worshipper of the elven gods.\n3 | I live in the moment, knowing my life could be turned upside down any day.\n4 | I appreciate beauty in all of its forms.\n5 | I hate the dark elves and the Netherese for each driving the elves out of Cormanthyr in the past.\n6 | I am a forest bumpkin who grew up in a tent in the woods and is wholly ignorant of city life.\n7 | I was raised alongside children of many other races. I harbor no racial prejudices at all.\n8 | The elves have just the right word for so many things that cannot be expressed as well in other languages. I pepper my speech with elven words, phrases, and sayings.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Patient. The elves have taught me to think and plan for the long-term. (Lawful)\n2 | Rebellious. Governments and politicians drove my family to the camps. I subtly defy authority whenever I think I can get away with it. (Chaotic)\n3 | Self - Absorbed. I've had to look out for number one so long that it has become second nature. (Any)\n4 | Wanderlust. I want to see as much of the world beyond the camps as I can. (Any)\n5 | Generous. I give everything I can to help those in need, regardless of who they are. (Good)\n6 | To the Abyss with Them. The people of Hillsfar cast me out. I won't risk my hide to help them. (Evil)\n\nd6 | Bond\n1 | The elves took me in when I had nowhere else to go. In return, I do what I can to help elves in need.\n2 | I seek revenge against the people of Hillsfar for driving my family into the forest.\n3 | My family lost everything when they were driven from Hillsfar. I strive to rebuild that fortune.\n4 | The forest has provided me with food and shelter. In return, I protect forests and those who dwell within.\n5 | I am deeply, tragically in love with someone whose racial lifespan is far longer or shorter than mine.\n6 | Members of my extended family did not make it to the camps or have been kidnapped to fight in the Arena. I search for them tirelessly.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n1 | I am very uncomfortable indoors and underground.\n2 | I am haughty. I grew up among the elves and emulate them. Other races are crude in comparison.\n3 | Elf this, elf that. I am sick and tired of the elves.\n4 | I am a miser. Having lost everything once before, I clutch my possessions and wealth very tightly.\n5 | I am a moocher. I am so used to others providing for me that I have come to expect everyone to do it.\n6 | I believe the gods have cursed me, my family, and all of the Cormanthor refugees. We are all doomed, doomed I tell you!\n\n"
