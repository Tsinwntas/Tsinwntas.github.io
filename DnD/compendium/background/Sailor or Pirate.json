When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.\n"

      "text": "Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.\nd8 | Personality Trait\n1 | My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.\n2 | I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.\n3 | I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale.\n4 | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.\n5 | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.\n6 | I never pass up a friendly wager.\n7 | My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.\n8 | I like a job well done, especially if I can convince someone else to do it.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good)\n2 | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)\n3 | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)\n4 | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)\n5 | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)\n6 | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)\n\nd6 | Bond\n1 | I'm loyal to my captain first, everything else second.\n2 | The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.\n3 | I'll always remember my first ship.\n4 | In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.\n5 | I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.\n6 | Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine.\n\nd6 | Flaw\n1 | I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong.\n2 | I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.\n3 | Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation.\n4 | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.\n5 | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.\n6 | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.\n\n"
