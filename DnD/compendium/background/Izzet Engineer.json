      "text": "Armed with an inventive intellect, a love of magical technology, and an unquenchable energy, you are an enthusiastic participant in the research work of the Izzet League. Though you're likely to begin your career as a mere attendant, you can aspire to become a skilled mage or alchemist, a laboratory supervisor, or even a flamethrower-wielding scorchbringer tasked with defending Izzet laboratories. The Izzet are obsessive, brilliant, inspired, and an unpredictable force of chaos in Ravnica, and you epitomize all of those qualities.\n• Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Investigation\n• Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools\n• Languages: Choose one of Draconic, Goblin, or Vedalken\n• Equipment: An Izzet insignia, one set of artisan's tools, the charred and twisted remains of a failed experiment, a hammer, a block and tackle, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp (Azorius 1-zino coins)\nSource: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 66"

      "text": "The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and explosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture—primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.\nYou have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.\n"

      "text": "Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature\nFor you, the spells on the Izzet Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)\nIzzet Guild Spells\nSpell Level | Spells\nCantrip | produce flame, shocking grasp\n1st | chaos bolt, create or destroy water, unseen servant\n2nd | heat metal, rope trick\n3rd | call lightning, elemental weapon, glyph of warding\n4th | conjure minor elementals, divination, Otiluke's resilient sphere\n5th | animate objects, conjure elemental\n\nYour spells tend to be loud, flashy, or explosive, even when the effect is unremarkable. For example, when you open the portal of a rope trick spell, the portal might be outlined by harmless, showy sparkles.\nIf you use an arcane focus, it probably takes the form of an intricate device that could include metal gauntlets, glass canisters, copper tubing, and leather straps attaching it to your body. The mizzium apparatus described in chapter 5 is a magical version of this gear.\nThe chaos bolt spell is a favorite of Izzet spellcasters because of its unpredictable nature.\n"

      "text": "Members of the Izzet League embody some combination of chaotic, frenetic energy with intellectual curiosity, in varying proportions. Some are committed to academic pursuits, and others just like explosions.\nPersonality Traits\nd8 | Personality Trait\n1 | I have a hard time staying focused on... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one... did I mention focus?\n2 | I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is!\n3 | It's not magic—or anything, really—if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I've got.\n4 | I do what my gut tells me.\n5 | Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens.\n6 | I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension.\n7 | Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts.\n8 | If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination.\n\nIdeals\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Guild. My guild is all that really matters. (Any)\n2 | Creativity. Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. (Chaotic)\n3 | Discovery. Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. (Any)\n4 | Science. A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. (Lawful)\n5 | Fun. I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do. (Chaotic)\n6 | Power. Someday I'll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in Ravnica. (Evil)\n\nBonds\nd6 | Bond\n1 | I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem.\n2 | I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me.\n3 | I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it.\n4 | I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources.\n5 | A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle.\n6 | I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do.\n\nFlaws\nd6 | Flaw\n1 | If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it.\n2 | I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen.\n3 | Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated.\n4 | I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.\n5 | I'm convinced there's not a soul in Ravnica, except maybe the great Niv-Mizzet, who can match my boundless intellect.\n6 | I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.\n\n"

      "name": "Contacts",
      "text": "The laboratories of the Izzet League are constantly starting up new projects and dissolving old ones, so it's easy for even the lowliest attendant to make friends (and enemies) in laboratories across Ravnica.\nRoll twice on the Izzet Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Izzet Contacts table.\nIzzet Contacts\nd8 | Contact\n1 | An older relative is a member of the guild's board of directors.\n2 | I know a sprite who carries important messages among the guild's laboratories.\n3 | A sibling is the head of a laboratory doing exotic research.\n4 | A former colleague is now an attendant in a laboratory in the central guildhall.\n5 | I'm in regular communication with an instructor who set me on the course of my life and research.\n6 | I had a romance with a chemister working in the Blistercoils.\n7 | As an attendant, I had a fierce rivalry with another attendant for our supervisor's attention.\n8 | The guildmaster, Niv-Mizzet, took note of one of my experiments!\n\nNon-Izzet Contacts\nd10 | Contact\n1 | An Azorius inspector seems interested in my work.\n2 | I was ready to join the Boros before I decided on Izzet, and I sometimes still hear from the sergeant who tried to recruit me.\n3 | One of my former assistants turned out to be a Dimir spy. We're not on friendly terms anymore, but we have a habit of running into each other.\n4 | A Golgari assassin killed a bitter rival of mine, leaving me with conflicted feelings.\n5 | I helped a minor Gruul chieftain acquire an Izzet weapon.\n6 | Roll an additional Izzet contact; you can decide if the contact is an ally or a rival.\n7 | An Orzhov banker financed my laboratory's current work and expects great returns.\n8 | I have a cousin in the Cult of Rakdos, and we get along quite well.\n9 | A former attendant from the same laboratory ran off to join the Selesnya, and we get into a big argument every time we run into each other.\n10 | I compare notes and techniques with a Simic scientist over lunch sometimes.\n\n"

      "name": "How Do I Fit In?",
      "text": "Whatever your role in the Izzet League, you are expected to contribute to its research in some way. That contribution might involve participating in tests, whether as an assistant, a researcher, or a subject. You might be one of the soldiers who protects a laboratory, or a laborer responsible for lifting heavy pieces of equipment into place. Everyone's contribution matters, even if the Izzet know that some matter more than others.\n"
