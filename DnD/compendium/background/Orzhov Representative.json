      "text": "The prospect of immense wealth is the promise of membership in the Orzhov Syndicate. All of the guild's endeavors channel wealth from Ravnican society into the ranks of the Orzhov—and concentrates the spoils at the top of the hierarchy. As a functionary in that system, your best hope is to claim as much as possible of the money that passes through your hands on its way up, so that you can work your way into a more prominent position.\nRegardless of your past and the wealth of your family, your initial status with the guild is near the bottom, until you have proven your value.\n• Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Religion\n• Languages: Two of your choice\n• Equipment: An Orzhov insignia, a foot-long chain made of ten gold coins, vestments, a set of fine clothes, and a belt pouch containing 1 pp (an Orzhov-minted 10-zino coin)\nSource: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 72"

      "text": "You can exert leverage over one or more individuals below you in the guild's hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power.\n"

      "text": "Members of the Orzhov Syndicate range from the decadent nobility at the top of the oligarchy to the debt-ridden wretches at the bottom. You fall somewhere between those extremes, so you might behave with the arrogance of the very rich or the humility of the impoverished.\nPersonality Traits\nd8 | Personality Trait\n1 | I am always willing to act in accordance with the financial incentive offered.\n2 | Debts are never meant to be forgiven.\n3 | I am accustomed to enjoying the finest pleasures money can buy.\n4 | No one could doubt that I am a cut above the masses of pitiful peasants that infest the city.\n5 | I can't stand to spend a zib more than necessary to purchase what I need.\n6 | I hate it when people try to make light of a serious situation.\n7 | I want to make sure everyone is aware of how wealthy, powerful, and important I am.\n8 | I can't think of anything to look forward to.\n\nIdeals\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Guild.

      "text": "The structure of the Orzhov Syndicate means that you are always doing the bidding of someone higher up the ladder than you are. Ultimately, your role in the guild is defined by whatever the people (and spirits) above you decide for you.\nFor most of your career, you can expect to engage in some aspect of the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild. That can mean throwing your weight around to enforce the will of the guild or using religious authority to extort offerings from the people. But it can also mean doing various errands for your superiors, from bearing messages to carrying out assassinations.\n"
