      "text": "A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of Privilege feature.\nAs an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart-in a chaste sort of devotion.\n"

      "text": "You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. One of your retainers is a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood (This person could be your bond.). Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).\nYour retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.\n"

      "text": "Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.\nd8 | Personality Trait\n1 | My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.\n2 | The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.\n3 | No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.\n4 | I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.\n5 | I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.\n6 | Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk.
