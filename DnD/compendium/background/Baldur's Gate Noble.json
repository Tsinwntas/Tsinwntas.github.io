      "text": "Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.\n"

      "text": "The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.\nAs a member of one of the elite families of Baldur's Gate, you may pass through city gates without paying tolls, mingle among the Gate's nobility unquestioned, and impress those on the lookout for wealthy patrons. You are welcome in the Upper City and may stay there after dark without being harassed or evicted. Your word is accepted over others' without question, and any corruption among guards or government officials tends to work in your favor, not against you—at least until you make some effort to expose it.\n"

      "text": "Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.\nd8 | Personality Trait\n1 | My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.\n2 | The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.\n3 | No one could doubt by looking at my regal bearing that I am a cut above the unwashed masses.\n4 | I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.\n5 | I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.\n6 | Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.\n7 | My favor, once lost, is lost forever.\n8 | If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.\n\nd6 | Ideal\n1 | Respect.
