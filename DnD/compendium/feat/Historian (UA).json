  "text": "Your study of history rewards you with the following benefits:\n• You gain proficiency in the History skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.\n• When you take the Help action to aid another creature's ability check, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, that creature's check gains a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus, as you share pertinent advice and historical examples. To receive this bonus, the creature must be able to understand what you're saying.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Feats For Skills p. 2",
