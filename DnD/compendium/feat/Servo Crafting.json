  "text": "You are skilled in the creation of servosâ€”tiny constructs that function as personal assistants. You can cast the find familiar spell as a ritual, creating a servo to serve as your familiar instead of an animal. A servo's statistics appear in the \"Artifact Creatures\" section of this document. In every other way, a servo familiar functions as described in the find familiar spell.\nYou can communicate telepathically with your servo familiar and perceive through its senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. You can speak through your servo in your own voice.\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your servo familiar to make one attack of its own.\nSource: Plane Shift: Kaladesh p. 13"
