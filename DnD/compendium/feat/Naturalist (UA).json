If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.\n• You learn the druidcraft and detect poison and disease spells. You can cast detect poison and disease once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Feats For Skills p. 3",
