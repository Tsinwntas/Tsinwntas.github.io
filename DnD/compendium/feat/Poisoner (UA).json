  "name": "Poisoner (UA)",
  "text": "You can prepare and deliver deadly poisons, gaining the following benefits:\n• When you make a damage roll, you ignore resistance to poison damage.\n• You can coat a weapon in poison as a bonus action, instead of an action.\n• You gain proficiency with the Poisoner (UA)'s kit if you don't already have it. With one hour of work using a Poisoner (UA)'s kit and expending 50 gp worth of materials, you can create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute, or until you hit with the weapon. When a weapon coated in this poison deals damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of your next turn.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Feats p. 2"
