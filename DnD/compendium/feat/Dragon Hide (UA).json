  "text": "You inherited the might and majesty of your dragon ancestors. You gain the following benefits:\n• Increase your Strength or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20\n• You grow retractable claws from the tips of your fingers. Extending or retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n• Your scales harden; you gain a +1 bonus to AC while you aren't wearing armor.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Feats For Races p. 2"
