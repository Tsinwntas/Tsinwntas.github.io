  "text": "You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:\n• Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.\n• Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.\n• Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.\nSource: Player's Handbook p. 170"
