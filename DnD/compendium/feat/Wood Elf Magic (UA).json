You also learn longstrider and pass without trace, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Feats For Races p. 4"
