  "text": "You have honed your ability to shape your personality and to read the personalities of others. You gain the following benefits:\n• You gain proficiency with the disguise kit. If you are already proficient with it, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.\n• If you spend 1 hour observing a creature, you can then spend 8 hours crafting a disguise you can quickly don to mimic that creature. Making the disguise requires a disguise kit. You must make checks as normal to disguise yourself, but you can assume the disguise as an action.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Feats p. 4",
