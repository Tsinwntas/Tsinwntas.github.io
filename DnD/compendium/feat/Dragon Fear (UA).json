  "text": "When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:\n• Increase your Strength or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20\n• Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can roar and expend a use of your breath weapon to force each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Feats For Races p. 2"
