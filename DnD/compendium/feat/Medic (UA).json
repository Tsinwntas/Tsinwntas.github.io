  "text": "You master the physician's arts, gaining the following benefits:\n• You gain proficiency in the Medic (UA)ine skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.\n• During a short rest, you can clean and bind the wounds of up to six willing beasts and humanoids. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medic (UA)ine) check for each creature. On a success, if a creature spends a Hit Die during this rest, that creature can forgo the roll and instead regain the maximum number of hit points the die can restore. A creature can do so only once per rest, regardless of how many Hit Dice it spends.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: Feats For Skills p. 2",
