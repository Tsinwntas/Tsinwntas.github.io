  "text": "Spiked armor is a rare type of medium armor made by dwarves. It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.\nYou have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor, which shimmers softly.\nIf you die while wearing the armor, it is destroyed, and each celestial, fey, and fiend with 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to its home plane of existence, unless it is already there.\nThe wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.\nSource: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 267"
