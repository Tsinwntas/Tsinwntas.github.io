For each point of bonus you choose for the sword, you take a corresponding penalty (−1 to −3) to your death saving throws. You can change this magical bonus each day at dawn.\nCurse: This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a remove curse spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.\nSource: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish p. 55"
