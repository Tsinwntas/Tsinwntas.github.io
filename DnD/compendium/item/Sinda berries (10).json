Picked berries lose their freshness and efficacy after 24 hours.\nFresh sinda berries can be eaten raw or crushed and added to a drink to dull the bitterness. A creature that consumes at least ten fresh sinda berries gains advantage on saving throws against disease and poison for the next 24 hours.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 205",
