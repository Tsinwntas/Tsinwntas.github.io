This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\nYou have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. This weapon loses its enchantment bonus permanently if it is exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.\nSource: Monster Manual p. 126, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",
