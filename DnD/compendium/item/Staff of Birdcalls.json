  "text": "This wooden staff is decorated with bird carvings. It has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds out to a range of 60 feet: a finch's chirp, a raven's caw, a duck's quack, a chicken's cluck, a goose's book, a loon's call, a turkey's gobble, a seagull's cry, an owl's hoot, or an eagle's shriek.\nThe staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.\nSource: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 139",
