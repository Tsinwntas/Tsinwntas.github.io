  "text": "A sling bullet of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both sling bullets of dragon slaying and sling bullets of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with a sling bullet of slaying takes damage from the sling bullet, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\nOnce a sling bullet of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical sling bullet.\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 152",
