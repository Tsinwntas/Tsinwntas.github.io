  "text": "This tattoo contains a single spell, wrought on your skin by a magic needle. To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin where you want the tattoo to appear and speak the command word. The needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on your skin. Once the tattoo is on your skin, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell's duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.\nA spell cast from this tattoo has a spellcasting ability modifier of +4, a save DC of 15 and an attack bonus of +7.\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Spells And Magic Tattoos p. 11"
