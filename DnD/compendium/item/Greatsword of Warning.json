In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.\nFound On: Magic Item Table F\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 213"
