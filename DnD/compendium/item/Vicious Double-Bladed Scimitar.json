This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\nWhen you roll a 20 with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 7 slashing damage.\nNote: According to the SRD, it is an extra 2d6 slashing damage.\nFound On: Magic Item Table G\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 209, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",
