It consists of a leather coat and leggings covered with spikes that are usually made of metal.\nThis suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.\nThe wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 150"
