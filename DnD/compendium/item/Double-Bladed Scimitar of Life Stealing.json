  "text": "Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\nWhen you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 necrotic damage if it isn't a construct or an undead. You also gain 10 temporary hit points.\nNote: According to the SRD, it is an extra 3d6 necrotic damage.\nFound On: Magic Item Table G\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 206, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",
