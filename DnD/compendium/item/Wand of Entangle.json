While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the entangle spell (save DC 13) from it.\nThe wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.\nSource: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 229",
