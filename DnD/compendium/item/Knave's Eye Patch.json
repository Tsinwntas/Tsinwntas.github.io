  "text": "While wearing this eye patch, you gain these benefits:\n• You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n• If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait.\n• You are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts or determine whether you are lying. Creatures can communicate telepathically with you only if you allow it.\nSource: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 191"
