  "text": "An arcane focus is a special item designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.\nAn orb of shielding is a polished, spherical chunk of crystal or stone aligned to one of the planes of existence. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this orb as a spellcasting focus.\nIf you're holding the orb when you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d4 (to a minimum of 0).\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 278, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 114",
