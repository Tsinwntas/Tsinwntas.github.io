A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.\nYou have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.\nWhen you roll a 20 with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 7 piercing damage.\nNote: According to the SRD, it is an extra 2d6 piercing damage.\nSource: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 149",
