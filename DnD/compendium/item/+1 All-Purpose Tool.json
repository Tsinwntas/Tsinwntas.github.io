  "text": "This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice (see the \"Equipment\" chapter in the Player's Handbook for a list of artisan's tools). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.\nWhile holding this tool, you gain a +1 bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells.\nAs an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 119"
