The save DC for the spell is 13.\nThe helm has 3 charges. To cast a spell from the helm, you must expend 1 charge, and the helm regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn.\nGod | Spell\nAthreos | protection from evil and good\nEphara | sanctuary\nErebos | inflict wounds\nHeliod | guiding bolt\nIroas | heroism\nKarametra | goodberry\nKeranos | thunderous smite\nKlothys | entangle\nKruphix | dissonant whispers\nMogis | hellish rebuke\nNylea | faerie fire\nPharika | lesser restoration\nPhenax | charm person\nPurphoros | searing smite\nThassa | identify\nSource: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 196",
