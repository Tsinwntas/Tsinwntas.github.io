  "text": "You can use this pen to write on any surface. You decide whether the writing is visible or invisible, but the writing is always visible to a person with the Mark of Scribing.\nAny creature with the Mark of Scribing can use an action to touch the invisible writing, making it visible to all.\nIf you use the pen to write on a creature that isn't a construct, the writing fades after 7 days.\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 278, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 115"
