  "text": "A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.\nWhen you roll a 20 with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 7 piercing damage.\nNote: According to the SRD, it is an extra 2d6 piercing damage.\nFound On: Magic Item Table G\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 209",
