This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for 1d12 hours.\nFound On: Magic Item Table G\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 214",
