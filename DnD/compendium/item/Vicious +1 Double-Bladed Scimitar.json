This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\nYou have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.\nWhen you roll a 20 with this magic weapon, the target takes an extra 7 slashing damage.\nNote: According to the SRD, it is an extra 2d6 slashing damage.\nSource: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 149, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",
