It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.\nWhen you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.\nProperty: Choose one creature who takes damage from the spell. That target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage.\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 133",
