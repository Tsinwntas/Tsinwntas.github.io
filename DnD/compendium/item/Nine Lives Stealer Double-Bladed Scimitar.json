  "text": "Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\nFound On: Magic Item Table H\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 183, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",
