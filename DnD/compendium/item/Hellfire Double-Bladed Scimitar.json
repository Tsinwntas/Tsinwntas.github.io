  "text": "Special: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\nThis weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.\nAny humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil.\nSource: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 223, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",
