It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.\nRoll a d4 and consult the Elemental Essence Shards table to determine the shard's essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.\nElemental Essence Shards\nd4 | Element | Shard\n1 | Air | Elemental Essence Shard (Air)\n2 | Earth | Elemental Essence Shard (Earth)\n3 | Fire | Elemental Essence Shard (Fire)\n4 | Water | Elemental Essence Shard (Water)\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 127"
