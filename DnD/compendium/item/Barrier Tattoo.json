When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.\nIf your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.\nBarrier Tattoo (Uncommon)\nBarrier Tattoo (Rare)\nBarrier Tattoo (Very Rare)\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Spells And Magic Tattoos p. 9"
