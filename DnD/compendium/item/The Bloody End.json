  "text": "Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.\nSentience: The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.\nPersonality: A tyrannical pit fiend named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.\nDormant: The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:\n• You can speak, read, and write Infernal.\n• You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\n• While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): charm person, dominate person, or fear. Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.\n• While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.\nAwakened: When the morningstar reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:\n• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.\n• The saving throw DC for spells cast from the morningstar increases to 15.\n• When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using The Bloody End, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n• When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 psychic damage to the attacker.\nExalted: When the morningstar reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:\n• The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.\n• Add dominate monster to the list of spells that can be cast from the morningstar.\n• The saving throw DC for spells cast from the morningstar, as well as for creatures to avoid being frightened by it, increases to 17.\n• When you use your reaction to deal psychic damage to a creature that hits you with a melee attack, the amount of psychic damage increases to 2d6.\nBetrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property.
