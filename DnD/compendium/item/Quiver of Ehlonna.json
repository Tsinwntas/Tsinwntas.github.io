The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrow, crossbow bolt, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelin or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaff, or spear.\nYou can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\nFound On: Magic Item Table F\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 189"
