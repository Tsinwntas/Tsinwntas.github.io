Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.\nWhile wearing this armor, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, whenever you start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, the armor causes you to rise 60 feet toward the surface. The armor is decorated with fish and shell motifs.\nThe wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.\nFound On: Magic Item Table B\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 181"
