Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.\nAlter Gravity: As an action, you can cast fly on yourself or you can cast levitate (save DC 15). Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.\nPart of a Whole: While this component is not installed in the Orrery of the Wanderer, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.\nSource: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 222"
