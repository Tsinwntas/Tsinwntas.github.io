  "text": "This finely carved pipe blows odorless bubbles instead of smoke when used. The pipe has 3 charges, and it regains all spent charges daily at dawn. While you hold the pipe, you can expend charges to gain access to the following properties:\n• You can cast fog cloud as an action (1 charge).\n• You can cast misty step as a bonus action (2 charges).\n• You can summon a steam mephit as an action (3 charges). The mephit is friendly to you, obeys your verbal commands, and acts on its own turn in the initiative order. It disappears in a harmless puff of steam after 1 minute or if it ends its turn more than 60 feet from the pipe.\nSource: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish p. 55"
