  "text": "You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.\nThe staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: cone of cold (5 charges), fog cloud (1 charge), ice storm (4 charges), or wall of ice (4 charges).\nThe staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.\nImprinted on this staff is a fragment of a dead wizard's personality. The first character who touches the staff gains the following flaw: \"I crave power above all else, and will do anything to obtain more of it.\" This flaw trumps any conflicting personality trait.\nFound On: Magic Item Table H\nSource: Curse of Strahd p. 187",
