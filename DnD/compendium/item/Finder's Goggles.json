  "text": "The lenses of these garish goggles are carved from Siberys dragonshards. While wearing these lenses, you gain the following benefits:\n• When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check.\n• As an action, you can use the goggles to examine an object to identify the aura of the last creature that touched it. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC of 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. On a success, you learn the creature's type and can immediately use the goggles to cast locate creature to find that creature. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\nSource: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 277, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 115"
