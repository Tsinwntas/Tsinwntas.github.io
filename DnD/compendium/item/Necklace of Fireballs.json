When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\nFound On: Magic Item Table C\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 182",
