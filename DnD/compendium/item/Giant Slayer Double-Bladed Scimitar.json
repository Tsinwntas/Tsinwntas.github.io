This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nWhen you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's type and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. For the purpose of this weapon, \"giant\" refers to any creature with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.\nFound On: Magic Item Table G\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 172, Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 74",
