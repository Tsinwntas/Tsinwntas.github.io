Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.\nThis weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.\nAny humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil.\nSource: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 223"
