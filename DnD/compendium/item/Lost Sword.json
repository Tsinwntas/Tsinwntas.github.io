  "text": "The Lost Sword is a sentient lawful good +1 shortsword (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.\nThe sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:\n• The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.\n• A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute.\n• While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the crusader's mantle spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.\nSource: Curse of Strahd p. 81"
