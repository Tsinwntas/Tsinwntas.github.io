When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.\nIf your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.\nSpellwrought Tattoo (Cantrip)\nSpellwrought Tattoo (1st Level)\nSpellwrought Tattoo (2nd Level)\nSpellwrought Tattoo (3rd Level)\nSpellwrought Tattoo (4th Level)\nSpellwrought Tattoo (5th Level)\nSource: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Spells And Magic Tattoos p. 11"
