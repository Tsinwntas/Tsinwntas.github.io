Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.\nThis suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.\nThe wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.\nIf the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.\nFound On: Magic Item Table H\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 150"
