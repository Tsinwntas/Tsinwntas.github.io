If your attunement to the vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash. You can use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells while wearing or holding it, and you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your sorcerer spells.\nIn addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover hit points while you are carrying the vial, you can regain 5 sorcery points. This property of the vial can't be used again until the next dawn.\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 122"
