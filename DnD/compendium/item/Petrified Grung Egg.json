If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you have used the egg, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\nAdditionally, while you are attuned to the egg, you gain resistance to poison damage.\nThe egg turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods.\nSource: Tomb of Annihilation p. 144"
