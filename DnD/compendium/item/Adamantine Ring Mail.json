  "text": "This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.\nThis suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.\nThe wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 150"
