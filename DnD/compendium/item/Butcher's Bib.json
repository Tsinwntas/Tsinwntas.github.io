You gain the following benefits while wearing the apron:\n• Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee attack with a weapon, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice. If you do so, you must use the second total.\n• Your weapon attacks that deal slashing damage score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.\nSource: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 266"
