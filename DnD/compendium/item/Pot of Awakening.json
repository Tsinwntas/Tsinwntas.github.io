  "text": "If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an awakened shrub at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.\nThe awakened shrub is friendly toward you. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.\nSource: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 138, Infernal Machine Rebuild p. 95"
