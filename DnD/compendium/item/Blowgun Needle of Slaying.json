  "text": "A blowgun needle of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both blowgun needles of dragon slaying and blowgun needles of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with a blowgun needle of slaying takes damage from the blowgun needle, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\nOnce a blowgun needle of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical blowgun needle.\nSource: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 152",
