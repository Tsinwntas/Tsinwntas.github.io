When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit while you're wearing the armor or wielding the shield that bears the emblem, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to turn the critical hit into a normal hit instead.\nThe emblem regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 128"
