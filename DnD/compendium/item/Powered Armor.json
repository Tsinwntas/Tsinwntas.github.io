  "text": "Powered armor resembles a suit of unusual plate armor, with finely articulated joints connected by an oily, black, leather-like material. The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings—only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion. On the back of the armor's left gauntlet is a rectangular metal box, from which projects a short rod tipped with a cone-shaped red crystal.\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:\n• You have a +1 bonus to AC.\n• Your Strength score is 18 (this has no effect if your Strength is already 18 or higher).\n• You have advantage on death saving throws.\nThe armor has further capabilities that can be powered either by energy cells or by your own life energy. You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits:\n• Emit a force field to gain 2d6 + 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Activate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Fire arm-mounted laser: Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. 2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Translate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Fill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).\n• Gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).\nThe armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges.\nPowered Armor Options: Depending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish's legendary powered armor.\nSource: Lost Laboratory of Kwalish p. 56",
