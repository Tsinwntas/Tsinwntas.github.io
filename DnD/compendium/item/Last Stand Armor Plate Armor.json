A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.\nYou have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor, which shimmers softly.\nIf you die while wearing the armor, it is destroyed, and each celestial, fey, and fiend with 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to its home plane of existence, unless it is already there.\nThe wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.\nIf the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.\nSource: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 267"
