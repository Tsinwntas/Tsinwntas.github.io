It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.\nRoll a d4 and consult the Outer Essence Shards table to determine the shard's essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.\nOuter Essence Shards\nd4 | Property | Shard\n1 | Lawful | Outer Essence Shard (Lawful)\n2 | Chaotic | Outer Essence Shard (Chaotic)\n3 | Good | Outer Essence Shard (Good)\n4 | Evil | Outer Essence Shard (Evil)\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 133"
