Hung on a leather thong, it is typically worn around the neck or attached to a belt.\nThis charm has 3 charges. While you bear the charm, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the speak with plants spell. For the duration of the spell, you also have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence the behavior, demeanor, and attitude of plants. The charm regains all expended charges at dawn each day.\nSource: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 229"
