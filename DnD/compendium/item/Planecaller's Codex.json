You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:\n• If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.\n• When you cast a conjuration spell that summons or creates one creature, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.\nSource: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 134",
