A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.\nThe Blast Scepter can be used as an arcane focus.\nWhoever is attuned to the Blast Scepter gains resistance to fire and lightning damage and can, as an action, use it to cast thunderwave as a 4th-level spell (save DC 16) without expending a spell slot.\nSource: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 310"
