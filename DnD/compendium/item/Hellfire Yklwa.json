  "text": "A yklwa (pronounced YICK-ul-wah) is a simple melee weapon that is the traditional weapon of Chultan warriors. A yklwa consists of a 3-foot wooden shaft with a steel or stone blade up to 18 inches long. Although it has the thrown weapon property, the yklwa is not well balanced for throwing.\nThis weapon is fashioned from infernal iron and traced with veins of hellfire that shed dim light in a 5-foot-radius.\nAny humanoid killed by an attack made with this weapon has its soul funneled into the River Styx, where it's reborn instantly as a lemure devil.\nSource: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 223"
